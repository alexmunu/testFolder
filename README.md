### A google-Mapping Geotagged Post from Twitter web application

__*Background*__

By now we are aware that Social Media has had a tremendous impact on our culture, in business, on the world-at-large. 
Social Media websites are some of the most popular point of communication on the internet. 
They have revolutionised the way people communicate and socialise on the Web. 
Aside from the world of gossiping, there are some positive and negative real impacts; and these are: 

IMPACT ON POLITICS: Politicians nowadays have realised how influencing are information spread on social networks. 
	               Social websites have played a vital role in many elections around the world.

IMPACT ON BUSINESS: Many companies have realised how Social Media eases the process in advertising their products build customers loyalty and many more.
 	              Since Social Media presence is cheap and effective, companies brand image come enhanced and more popular.

IMPACT ON SOCIALISATION: Social Networking has made it possible to connect different people around the world to share and discover various kind of interest. 
	                        On it people can learn about different cultures and societies by connecting with people in other countries.

Two questions I put myself:

1. How to use this technologies to improve our society? 
2. How to prevent bad behaviours to arise in our society?

The initial reasoning has brought to the conclusion that we should be able to prevent harmful behaviours by analysing society trends, opinions or actions.

__*Solution*__

The objective of this project is to create an analytical tool that eases investigation of social network to prevent bad behaviours in the social. This Web application will benefit from using Social Media data
by implementing the MEAN stack methodology. 
The final result is to develop a Google-Mapping geotagged Post from Twitter Web Application with functionalities such as:

1. The plot of tweets by searched keyword on a map according to location. 
2. List of tweets related to users by the keyword/hashtag. 
3. A map with the ability to zoom in and scroll around.
4. A Clustering to group nearest tweets in one marker.

__*Requirements*__

1. Install MongoDB
   1. The installation process outlined shortly is as follows:
   2. Download and extract the archive file
   3. Run mongod binary (usually located in the bin folder of the extracted archive)
   4. Create the folder to store the database files (the default folder is /data/db)
   5. Make sure port 27017 is free to use
2. Install Node.js
3. Navigate to the TwitTrack folder and run in command line the instruction: npm install
4. The application will listen on port 30000. (Make sure port 3000 is free)
5. On a web browser insert url http://127.0.0.1:3000 to run application.
